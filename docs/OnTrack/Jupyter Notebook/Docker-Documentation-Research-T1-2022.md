## Conversion Relating to Docker Processes

[<img src="docker_flow.png" />](docker_flow.png)

The API container gets the input file from the frontend. If this input file needs to be converted,
the API container will first put it into a location **known** to the conversion container (i.e., a
_temp_ directory in a shared volume). The shared _temp_ directory ensures that both the API
container **and** the conversion container have read and write access to the input and output files.
Note that this _temp_ directory will be the shared volume specified in `docker-compose.yml`.

The API container will then: tell the conversion container to start, perform the conversion process,
and then `exit`. Note that the conversion process will read from the _temp_ directory and write the
output to the _temp_ directory.

The entire bash script might look something like this:

```shell
cp input-file /temp-directory # copy the input file into the shared directory
docker run --rm conversion-image bash -c "convert temp-directory/input-file" # run the conversion container with the command to convert
rm temp-directory/input-file # remove the input file after it has been converted
```

**How do we tell the API container whether it was a success or failure??? Need more research into
this**

If the file conversion was a success, the API container will then read the output file from the temp
directory and pass it on to the next steps. The files in the _temp_ directory can now be safely
removed by the API container to free up space for the next conversion.
